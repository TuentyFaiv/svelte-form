title: How it works
description: To use Yup, Zod you need to install the corresponding adapter.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import {
  ZodAdapter,
} from "@organisms";

Adapters are used to convert a schema to a format that `faivform` can understand. This is necessary because each schema validation library has its own format.

## Little roadmap

- [x] [`Zod`](https://zod.dev/)
- [x] [`Yup`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
- [ ] [`Joi`](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.12.0)
- [ ] [`Superstruct`](https://docs.superstructjs.org)

If you want to use another schema validation library, you can create your [own adapter.](/guides/adapters/). Also you can request a new adapter by creating an issue in the [repository](https://github.com/TuentyFaiv/svelte-form/issues/new).
